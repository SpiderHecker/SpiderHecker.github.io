    <p class="username">superior.intellect(THIS IS MY DISCORD)</p>
    <p>In the Middle Ages, fire dragons were revered as kings and gods or else feared by townspeople and peasants. 
      Fire dragons would often plunder villages. Fire Dragon scales are superbly tough and strong, not even a Knights sword can cut through the scales and hide. In fiction and mythology, the ability of dragons to exhale fire, or any of several things which allude to this power. 
    If you wanna know more about Fire dragons add my discord thats above the paragraph</p>
